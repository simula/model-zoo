summary: "Not an actual model, just a template for model descriptions."
draft: false

The following categories should be provided when documenting a model:

### Dependencies

Instructions for how to install dependencies, for example downloading and
installing from a `requirements.txt` file (if using `pip`), a 
`environment.yml` file (if using `conda`), or something else.


### Download and import the model

Instructions for loading the model into the relevant framework, which is nice
to have since it often differs. 

### Data

Please provide some test data that the model can be run over and validated
against, to ensure things are working. Here one can ideally also describe the
dataset, and list its expected shape.

### Preprocessing

Either in a separate section or in the section above, detail the steps required
to preprocess the data. Lacking or incorrect preprocessing is guaranteed to
lead to trouble down the road.

### Other

Other information can be added where needed; examples and code snippets are
encouraged.
