Generate unlimited realistic deepfake ECGs using the deep generative model:Pulse2pulse introduced in our full paper here: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.27.21256189 (DeepFake electrocardiograms: the key for open science for artificial intelligence in medicine) 


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pypi.org/project/deepfake-ecg/) to install deepfake-ecg generator.



```bash
pip install deepfake-ecg
```

## Usage


The generator functions can generate DeepFake ECGs with 8-lead values  [lead names from first coloum to eighth colum: **'I','II','V1','V2','V3','V4','V5','V6'**] for 10s (5000 values per lead). These 8-leads format can be converted to 12-leads format using the following equations. 

```
lead III value = (lead II value) - (lead I value)
lead aVR value = -0.5*(lead I value + lead II value)
lead aVL value = lead I value - 0.5 * lead II value
lead aVF value = lead II value - 0.5 * lead I value

```

### Run on CPU (default setting)

```python
import deepfakeecg

#deepfakeecg.generate("number of ECG to generate", "Path to generate", "start file ids from this number", "device to run") 

deepfakeecg.generate(5, ".", start_id=0, run_device="cpu") # Generate 5 ECGs to the current folder starting from id=0
```

### Run on GPU

```python
import deepfakeecg

#deepfakeecg.generate("number of ECG to generate", "Path to generate", "start file ids from this number", "device to run") 

deepfakeecg.generate(5, ".", start_id=0, run_device="cuda") # Generate 5 ECGs to the current folder starting from id=0
```
### Pre-generated DeepFake ECGs and corresponding MUSE reports are here: https://osf.io/6hved/

- In this repository, there are two DeepFake datasets:
  1. 150k dataset - Randomly generated 150k DeepFakeECGs
  2. Filtered all normals dataset - Only "Normal" ECGs filtered using the MUSE analysis report
