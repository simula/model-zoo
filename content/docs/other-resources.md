Most ML frameworks provide pretrained models for image recognition tasks, which
can be downloaded and used for classification right away. Or, one can replace
the classification layer and fine-tune on a different dataset -- or remove the
classification layer entirely, and use the base model for feature extraction.
Have a look at the following links for available models:

[Keras models](https://keras.io/api/applications/)

[PyTorch models](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html)

[MXNet models](https://mxnet.apache.org/api/python/docs/api/gluon/model_zoo/index.html)
